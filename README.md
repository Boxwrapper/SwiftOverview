# An overview on Swift

You can find the script alongside the presentation in the `script.pdf` file. The presentation itself is housed in the Swift playground `presentation.playground`. The file can be opened with `Xcode` on a Mac or the `Swift Playgrounds` app on iPad. The file itself really is just a folder, in which all the source files are contained. So feel free to dig into the code, no matter what platform you're on.
